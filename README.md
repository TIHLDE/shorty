## üöÄ Getting started

Shorty requires Node and Yarn.

```
# Setup a local repository
git clone https://github.com/TIHLDE/shorty.git
cd shorty

# If this is your first time running the application
yarn

# Thats it!
```

From now on it's enough to run `yarn dev` to run the application.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

Shorty is a short-link service created to handle the SEO-problem with SPA's.
The events, news, jobposts and pages on tihlde.org have their own short link on shorty
with Open Graph-metadata which improves the look when shared on social media.
Shorty is hosted on s.tihlde.org which gives us these beatiful URL's:

- Events: https://s.tihlde.org/a/[id]/
- Jobposts: https://s.tihlde.org/k/[id]/
- News: https://s.tihlde.org/n/[id]/
- Pages: https://s.tihlde.org/om/[slug]/

In addition, members of TIHLDE have access to create their own custom short-links with the URL: https://s.tihlde.org/[slug]
